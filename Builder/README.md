# Builder Design Pattern
The Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern used in software design to construct a complex object step by step. It allows the construction of a product in a step-by-step fashion, where the construction process can vary based on the type of product being built. The pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

## Components
### Product
The **Product** is the complex object that the Builder pattern is responsible for constructing.
- It may consist of multiple components or parts, and its structure can vary based on the implementation.
- The Product is typically a class with attributes representing the different parts that the Builder constructs.
### Builder
The **Builder** is an interface or an abstract class that declares the construction steps for building a complex object.
- It typically includes methods for constructing individual parts of the product.
- By defining an interface, the Builder allows for the creation of different concrete builders that can produce variations of the product.
### ConcreteBuilder
**ConcreteBuilder** classes implement the Builder interface, providing specific implementations for building each part of the product.
- Each ConcreteBuilder is tailored to create a specific variation of the product.
- It keeps track of the product being constructed and provides methods for setting or constructing each part.
### Director
The **Director** is responsible for managing the construction process of the complex object.
- It collaborates with a Builder, but it doesnâ€™t know the specific details about how each part of the object is constructed.
- It provides a high-level interface for constructing the product and managing the steps needed to create the complex object.
### Client
The Client is the code that initiates the construction of the complex object.
- It creates a Builder object and passes it to the Director to initiate the construction process.
- The Client may retrieve the final product from the Builder after construction is complete.
