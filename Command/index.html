            <p>
                The Command Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that
                turns a request into a stand-alone object, allowing
                parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of
                requests, and support for undoable operations(action or a series
                of actions that can be reversed or undone in a system).

                        <strong>Command Interface</strong> The Command Interface
                        is like a rulebook that all command classes follow. It
                        declares a common method, <code>execute()</code>,
                        ensuring that every concrete command knows how to
                        perform its specific action. It sets the standard for
                        all commands, making it easier for the remote control to
                        manage and execute diverse operations without needing to
                        know the details of each command.

                        <strong>Concrete Command Classes</strong> Concrete
                        Command Classes are the specific commands, like turning
                        on a TV or adjusting the stereo volume. Each class
                        encapsulates the details of a particular action. These
                        classes act as executable instructions that the remote
                        control can trigger without worrying about the
                        nitty-gritty details of how each command accomplishes
                        its task.

                        <strong>Invoker (Remote Control)</strong> The Invoker,
                        often a remote control, is the one responsible for
                        initiating command execution. It holds a reference to a
                        command but doesn’t delve into the specifics of how each
                        command works. It’s like a button that, when pressed,
                        makes things happen. The remote control’s role is to
                        coordinate and execute commands without getting involved
                        in the complexities of individual actions.

                        <strong>Receiver (Devices)</strong> The Receiver is the
                        device that knows how to perform the actual operation
                        associated with a command. It could be a TV, stereo, or
                        any other device. Receivers understand the specific
                        tasks mentioned in commands. If a command says, “turn
                        on,” the Receiver (device) knows precisely how to
                        execute that action. The Receiver-Command relationship
                        separates responsibilities, making it easy to add new
                        devices or commands without messing with existing
                        functionality.
