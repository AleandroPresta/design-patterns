            <p>
                The Flyweight design pattern is a structural pattern that
                focuses on optimizing memory usage by sharing a common state
                among multiple objects. It aims to reduce the number of objects
                created and to decrease memory footprint, particularly useful
                when dealing with a large number of similar objects.

            <p>
                The Flyweight design pattern typically consists of the following
                components:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Flyweight Interface/Class</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Defines the interface through which flyweight
                            objects can receive and act on extrinsic state.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Concrete Flyweight Classes</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Implements the Flyweight interface and represents
                            objects that can be shared.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Stores intrinsic state (state that can be shared)
                            and provides methods to manipulate intrinsic state
                            if needed.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Flyweight Factory</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Manages a pool of flyweight objects.</li>
                        <li>
                            Provides methods for clients to retrieve or create
                            flyweight objects.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ensures flyweight objects are shared appropriately
                            to maximize reusability.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Client</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Uses flyweight objects to perform operations.</li>
                        <li>
                            Maintains or passes extrinsic state to flyweight
                            objects when needed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Does not manage the lifecycle of flyweight objects
                            directly but interacts with them via the factory.
                        </li>
